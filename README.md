## Settler of Catan

* A popular board game that is made into a video game in this code.
* The game consists of conquering territories, obtaining ressources to build and accumulating points according to one's possessions.
* The first player to reach 10 points is declared the winner.

* We will stay on the very basic rules but this game can be understood with multiple rules which consequently increases its complexity.
